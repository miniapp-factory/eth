A quiz that allows someone to find out which animal (cat, dog, fox, hamster, horse) they are most similar to by answering 5 multiple choice questions and be able to share result. Generate an image for each animal in a cute cartoon vector style and display it on the result page. Allow the user to retake the quiz as many times as they want. Write the questions and answers yourself. Randomize the order of the answers for each question.

Place the quiz on the home page.

#### Code the following app

#### A quiz that allows someone to find out which animal (cat, dog, fox, hamster, horse) they are most similar to by answering 5 multiple choice questions and be able to share result. Generate an image for each animal in a cute cartoon vector style and display it on the result page. Allow the user to retake the quiz as many times as they want.

#### Place the quiz on the home page.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The following files in your repository are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added to implement the quiz, generate the animal images, and update the app logo and metadata:

1. **mini-app/app/page.tsx** – to place the quiz component on the home page.  
2. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – to update the app title, description, and share URL.  
3. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – to generate a new app logo.  
4. **mini-app/public/cat.png.todo** – to generate a cute cartoon vector image for the cat.  
5. **mini-app/public/dog.png.todo** – to generate a cute cartoon vector image for the dog.  
6. **mini-app/public/fox.png.todo** – to generate a cute cartoon vector image for the fox.  
7. **mini-app/public/hamster.png.todo** – to generate a cute cartoon vector image for the hamster.  
8. **mini-app/public/horse.png.todo** – to generate a cute cartoon vector image for the horse.  
9. **mini-app/components/quiz.tsx** – new component that implements the quiz logic and UI.  
10. **mini-app/components/quiz-result.tsx** – new component that displays the quiz result and share button.  

These are the files that will need to be edited or added to satisfy the requested functionality.

I’ll need a few more files to implement the quiz and the images.  
Please add the following files to the chat so I can provide the required edits:

```
mini-app/components/quiz.tsx
mini-app/components/quiz-result.tsx
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
mini-app/public/cat.png.todo
mini-app/public/dog.png.todo
mini-app/public/fox.png.todo
mini-app/public/hamster.png.todo
mini-app/public/horse.png.todo
```

Once those are added, I’ll supply the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the changes to `mini-app/app/page.tsx` and `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`.

#### apply changes  

I need the files that will contain the new quiz logic and the image‑generation todos before I can create the required edits.  
Please add the following files to the chat:

```
mini-app/components/quiz.tsx
mini-app/components/quiz-result.tsx
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
mini-app/public/cat.png.todo
mini-app/public/dog.png.todo
mini-app/public/fox.png.todo
mini-app/public/hamster.png.todo
mini-app/public/horse.png.todo
```

Once those are added, I’ll provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to apply the changes.
